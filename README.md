Once on the Releases page:

1. Look for the latest version.
2. Click on it to view the available files.
3. Download the `.aar` file.

If you're using Gradle, you can also add it directly to your project. Add the following line to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
implementation 'com.example:easyandroidpermissions:x.x.x' // Replace x.x.x with the latest version
```

## ⚙️ Using the Library
Once you have the library in your project, follow these steps to use it:

1. **Initialize the Permission Manager:**
   Begin by importing the necessary classes and initializing the permission manager in your activity or fragment.

```kotlin
import com.example.easyandroidpermissions.PermissionManager

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private val permissionManager = PermissionManager()
}
```

2. **Requesting Permissions:**
   When you need to request permissions, simply call the `requestPermission` function.

```kotlin
val permissionResult = permissionManager.requestPermission(Manifest.permission.CAMERA)

if (permissionResult.isGranted) {
    // Permission granted, proceed with the action
} else {
    // Permission denied, handle accordingly
}
```

3. **Handling Permission Result:**
   You can easily handle the result in a lifecycle-aware manner without needing to write callback methods.

4. **Suspending Functions:**
   Use the suspend functions to manage permissions without hassle.

```kotlin
lifecycleScope.launch {
    val result = permissionManager.requestPermissionSuspend(Manifest.permission.CAMERA)

    if (result) {
        // Permission granted, proceed with the action
    } else {
        // Permission denied, inform the user
    }
}
```
